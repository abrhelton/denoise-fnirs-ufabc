# Noise removal from functional near-infrared spectroscopy - fNIRS

The intent of this work is to develop some satisfatory deep learning autoenconder models capable of cleaning fNIRS data by using different
techniques.

The neural networks developed were created from PyTorch framework
and were infused with data from tons of different public and avaliable
data acrross the nternet with quality guaranteed by scientists which work
on similar subject.

Type of NN used in this regard:
- Vanilla Autoencoder
- Sparse Autoencoder
- Denoising Auutoencoder
- Undercomplete Autoencoder
- Contractive Autoencoder
- Convolutional Autoencoder
- Variational Autoencoder

The main idea is to compare the performance and accuracy of each
technnique which removes noisy from data, getting the essencial
feature of them
