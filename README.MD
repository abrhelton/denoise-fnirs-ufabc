# Noise removal from unctional near-infrared spectroscopy - fNIRS

The intent of this work is to develop some satisfatory deep learning autoenconder models capable of cleaning fNIRS data by using different
techniques.

The neural networks developed were created from PyTorch framework
and were infused with data from tons of different public and avaliable
data acrross the nternet with quality guaranteed by scientists which work
on similar subject.

Type of NN used in this regard:
- Vanilla autoencoder
- Sparse autoencoder
- Denoising autoencoder
- Undercomplete autoencoder
- Contractive autoencoder
- Convolutional autoencoder
- Variational Autoencoder
